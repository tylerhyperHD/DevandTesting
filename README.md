# DevandTesting [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tylerhyperHD/DevandTesting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tylerhyperHD/DevandTesting)

This plugin used to be the private plugin that I wouldn't share with anyone back with freedom mods. Now, it's public, and it's better than ever.

## Features
- /admin - to change your gamemode. That's all there is to it, plus it's fully customizable.
- /multirun - to use for your entertainment.
- /color - to set the color of your messages. Let their be rainbows.
- /dab - to be apart of the clout daemons.
- /website - for full added customizations.
- /spectator - (Being removed soon)
- /lagg - Soon to be multi-usage. Clears all entities within the area for now.
- /kill - Fully customizable to make people laugh more often.
<div>Also a fully custom player join listener has been added to make joining the game more exciting.</div>

## Insane-Only Features
<p>With insane mode toggled on in the config, these are some of the features you can see:</p>
<ul>
  <li>/insane - The toggler of insane mode. Use it only when the config has it turned on.</li>
  <li>/purple - Gracing the world with purple. Still has some issues yet is very awesome.</li>
  <li>/blowup - Blowup a player.</li>
</ul>

## Permissions
<div>The only few permissions you will need if you are using something like PEX are:</div>
<ul>
  <li><code>devandtesting.admin</code> - Allows you to change to your admin mode as well as a lot of other stuff. Given to ops by default.</li>
  <li><code>devandtesting.admin.others</code> - Allows you to set the admin mode of other players temporarily. This isn't given to ops so a permissions plugin is a must.</li>
  <li><code>devandtesting.color</code> - Allows you to change your message color. Given to ops by default.</li>
  <li><code>devandtesting.insane</code> - Gives permission for someone to run the insane commands. This isn't given to ops so a permissions plugin is a must.</li>
</ul>


## Coming Soon
- [ ] More commands for your enjoyment
- [ ] Inventory control for purple materials
