# DevandTesting

This plugin used to be the private plugin that I wouldn't share with anyone back with freedom mods. Now, it's public, and it's better than ever.

## Features
- /admin - to change your gamemode. That's all there is to it, plus it's fully customizable.
- /multirun - to use for your entertainment.
- /color - to set the color of your messages. Let their be rainbows.
- /dab - to be apart of the clout daemons.
- /website - for full added customizations.
- /spectator - (Being removed soon)
- /lagg - Soon to be multi-usage. Clears all entities within the area for now.
- /kill - Fully customizable to make people laugh more often.
Also a fully custom player join listener has been added to make joining the game more exciting.

## Coming Soon
- Adaptive inventories so no cheating can be involved (for survival servers)
- Adding a /insane command to the mix which is disabled by default. This command will be an abusive one, so proceed only if u want to.
- Adding a slew of commands not attached to the MIT license that will be part of a different section in the code

This code is under the MIT license. Any questions with the license should be addressed in the issues section of this repository.
